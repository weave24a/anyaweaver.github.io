Hi! My name is Anya, and I am a Senior at Mount Holyoke College. I am interested in machine learning and statistics!

knitr::include_graphics("Merlin Pymol.jpg")
```

This is an image of two views of the merlin protein, made in Pymol. It is a protein produced by the NF2 gene and is responsible for many cellular functions.
